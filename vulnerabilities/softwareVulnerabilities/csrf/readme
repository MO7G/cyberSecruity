to run the server run it in the root of the folder using the command 
"npx serve ." 

now once try to run the protectedServer and once try to run the server-vul and be careful to run them both on localhost 3000


don't forget when you run both server try to copy your localhost server which runs the html using the npx serve . and paste to 
core of the backend server so it can accept your requests!
